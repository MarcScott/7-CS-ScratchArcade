<li>These "Hackers" sound like a very nasty bunch of people.
</li>
<li>Then again, there are these things called "Hackathons" like <a href="https://gigaom.com/2012/09/07/googles-develop-for-good-hackathon-winners-tackle-environment-human-rights/">this one</a> that seems focused on producing solutions to climate change and human rights.

<li>Another method used by crackers is called <i>Social Engineering</i>. This relies on using Psychological techniques to get users to allow a cracker access to their computer or accounts.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Phishing

<li>Phishing is a method of social engineering whereby the crackers send out emails to their intended targets.
</li>
<li>They might ask them to send personal details, or download a particular file.
</li>
<li>The details can be used to commit identity fraud, and the files to be downloaded are almost always malware.

<li>Have a look at this email.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-9">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Pretexting is a little trickier to perform.
</li>
<li>The cracker will usually phone up a target on some <i>pretext</i> such as that their bank account has seen some suspicious activity. They will then ask for personal details and even passwords over the phone, which will allow the cracker to gain access to the victims accounts.
</li>
<li>Sometimes the victim isn't even involved in <i>Pretexting</i>. A cracker might phone up Amazon, for instance, and convince a staff member that they need to reset the victims password.

<li>A cracker will load a USB drive with malware and then leave it somewhere, like a coffee shop or the floor of a car-park.
