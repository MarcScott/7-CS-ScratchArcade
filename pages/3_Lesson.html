<li>Just like you can track someone following their footprints, you can track someone online by following their digital footprint.
</li>
<li>A digital footprint is the information that you leave behind when online.
</li>
<li>There are two types of digital footprint:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Active
</li>
<li>Passive
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your active footprint is the information you intentionally leave online. This could be emails that you've written, posts that you have made on social networks or photos you've uploaded.
</li>
<li>Your passive footprint is the information that is collected about you through no direct action you have taken. This could be you IP address when browsing a website, your search engine queries or your location as tracked by your mobile service provider.

<li>Unless you are willing to make some major changes to the way you use the Internet, there is not a huge amount you can do to limit your passive footprint.
</li>
<li>Your active footprint is completely in your control, however.

<li>Create a table, detailing all the digital services you use (Snapchat, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc.)
</li>
<li>For each one, write down how many messages and photos you sent/uploaded using the service.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A decade ago, photos were usually physical artefacts. You had a single copy and if it was lost or destroyed, it was gone forever.
</li>
<li>Today photos are digital - 1s and 0s on a computer hard-drive.
</li>
<li>When you post a photo to Instagram, you make a copy that sits on Instagram's servers.
</li>
<li>Anyone who sees your photo can easily save it to their own computer or phone. Even if you delete the photo, there is no guarantee that Instagram will delete it from their servers.
</li>
<li>As a rule of thumb, once a photo or message has been placed online, it is public <b>forever</b>.

<li>Many people convince themselves that it doesn't matter what they post, because they have checked all their privacy settings, so their photos are not in the public domain.
</li>
<li>What they often don't realise, is that a company's terms and conditions means they get to keep copies of all your photos.
</li>
<li>These companies are often bought and sold. Instagram for instance is now owned by Facebook, meaning Facebook have access to all your photos.
</li>
<li>You simply don't know which company or organisation is going to own your posts and photos in 5, 10 or 20 years time.
</li>
<li>And as for the Government - they can easily ask any of the companies to hand over your data at any time.
